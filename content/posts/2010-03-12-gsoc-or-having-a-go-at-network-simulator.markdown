title: GSOC or Having a go at Network Simulator
---


I had been looking at this years [Google Summer Of Code](http://code.google.com/soc/) google [group ](http://groups.google.com/group/google-summer-of-code-discuss)and saw the[ list of  organisations](http://spreadsheets.google.com/pub?key=t-XzUSGaMoJIM9lPmCMVezA&output=html) that are getting involved. While i was alooking at it, I knew i didn't want to even consider the big boys (I'm looking at you, [Debian](http://debian-community.org/planets/), [Drupal](http://drupal.org/contributors-guide), [KDE](http://www.kdedevelopers.org/), [Apache](http://www.apache.org/dev/), [X.Org](http://wiki.x.org/wiki/ModularDevelopersGuide), etc), they're too big to get my teeth into, and I'm currently in the throws of 'WHAT THE HELL AM I GOING TO DO MY FINAL YEAR PROJECT ON!!! ' (For any Americans, that means 'dissertation').

My [university ](http://www.qub.ac.uk/schools/eeecs/)is big into networking etc, so I had a look at the [NS-3 Network Simulator](http://www.nsnam.org/), which currently sits at slightly less that 2 million lines of code, and is vaguinly within my realm of interest so I'm going to see a) if i can get it to work and play with it for a bit and b) if i can contribute anything to the project and parlay that into a final year project, and I'll be documenting whatever progress I get on this blog.

I doubt that I'll apply to [GSOC](http://code.google.com/soc/) as I don't think I'd be able to give the required time committment over the summer. :(

Anyway, Next blog post will be a start into the installation and configuration of NS-3 on my virtualised Ubuntu setup.
