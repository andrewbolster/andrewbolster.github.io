Well, I've finally joined the washed masses in actually having my own domain. Lovely new years deal from DreamHost. 10 bucks for 2 years, brilliant. Thanks [Lifehacker](http://lifehacker.com)

Anyway, hope it all goes well.

Also, merry christmas and a happy new year to all. I got an XBox 360, and will eventually do a little write up on making it talk to my My Book World Edition
