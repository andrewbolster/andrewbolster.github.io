## Next Steps

1. **Review this mapping** - User should review proposed consolidations
2. **Adjust as needed** - Some tags may need to stay separate or be grouped differently
3. **Generate migration script** - Create script to update all post front matter
4. **Apply changes** - Run migration across all posts
5. **Verify** - Rebuild site and confirm tag count is within target

## Notes

- Some specific technology names (e.g., "Claude", "ChatGPT") might be worth keeping separate for discoverability
- Person names (authors, researchers) should probably be deleted rather than consolidated
- Conference names could either stay separate or consolidate to "Conferences"
- The mappings above are suggestions - user discretion advised on final decisions
