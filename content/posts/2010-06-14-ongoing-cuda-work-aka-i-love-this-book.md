title: Ongoing CUDA work, aka, I love this book.

If anyone has any interest in [CUDA](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CUDA), or [GPU](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GPGPU)/[Parallel](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parallel%20computing) programming in general, [David B. Kirk](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David%20Kirk%20%28scientist%29) and [Wen-mei Hwu](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wen-mei%20Hwu)'s groundbreaking "[Programming Massively Parallel Processors](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0123814723?tag=apture-20)" is a must.

The sub-title of the book is "A Hands on Approach" and I didn't get it until a third of the way through the book, that that's exactly what it is. The pairing of Kirk, a [NVIDIA Fellow, outgoing NVIDIA Chief Scientist](http://www.nvidia.com/object/bio_kirk.html) and generally world-weary technologist and all round 'hardware guru' with Hwu, [a well-heeled educator and researcher at the University of Illinois](http://impact.crhc.illinois.edu/people/current/hwu.php) provide a practical but in-depth look at not just the pure 'programming' to deal with massivly parallel processing, but instead assumes that the reader can work out for instance how to do [Matrix Multiplication](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matrix%20multiplication) the 'basic' way from looking at the [NVIDIA CUDA API's](http://www.nvidia.com/object/cuda_home.html), and looks at how to take advantage of the hardware to give sometimes incredible speed increases.

I'm currently still working through it; reading a few chapters ahead and then going back and doing all the exercises in [emulation mode](http://www.ncsa.illinois.edu/UserInfo/Training/Workshops/CUDA/presentations/tutorial-CUDA.html) (access to a remote machine has been problematic, so if anyone wants to lend me shell access to a cuda machine, I'd appreciate it.)

For anyone looking at this field, this is the bible!
