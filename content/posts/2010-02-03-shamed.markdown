title: Shamed
---


I am shamed. I've let this blog slip in the midst of coming back to the real world of Uni.

A week without something useful going up! Terrible... *stands in corner*

Fact is I've been experimenting with so many different things that nothing cogent has come out of it yet.

Some of the things I've been working on:


  * Virtual Lab- Walk through of the setup and playing with of a virtual computer lab using VirtualBox including Windows, Ubuntu, FreeBSD, Fedora, and Debian servers/clients


  * Write up of my automated downloading system and the scripts associated with it


  * Exploration of Setup of a VPN using the WRT54G or my MyBook


  * A first-timers walk through of setting up Google Adwords campaigns

And somewhere in between all that I've been working and getting back to Uni...

Joy.
