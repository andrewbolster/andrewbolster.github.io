My attention span isnt really that great with projects, so the thought of doing the entire [Project Euler](http://projecteuler.net/) in several different languages was never realistically getting off the ground.  (FYI [Problems All On One Page](http://projecteuler.net/index.php?section=view_all) )

So, modification and extension to the previous idea; Take one random number generator ([java.util.random](http://www.cs.geneseo.edu/~baldwin/reference/random.html)) and a list of languages I think I should have at least a cursory knowledge of. Each time I finish one problem, push a button and it tells me what language to use for the next one.

Simple enough; So this is the list as of today



	
  1. [C](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_(programming_language))

	
  2. [C++](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%2B%2B)

	
  3. [C#](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_Sharp_(programming_language))

	
  4. [Java](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_(programming_language))

	
  5. [Scala](http://www.scala-lang.org/)

	
  6. [JavaScript](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript)

	
  7. [PHP](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PHP)

	
  8. [Bash](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bash)

	
  9. [Ruby](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ruby_(programming_language))

	
  10. [Python](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_(programming_language))

	
  11. [Perl](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perl)


To my shame i have never touched C#, JavaScript, Ruby or Python, so all in all its going to be very interesting how much i screw up. Other than "experience level" i think the list is fairly cult-agnostic; 3C-ish, 3 Java-esque, 3 Web languages, Good mix of interpreted and compiled languages, along with a few "script" lingos to keep it down to earth.

If anyone is interested in the [Subversion ](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subversion_(software))repo, so look at and mock my work and organisation, its [here](http://andrewbolster.info/euler ).

If anyone you reads this has any comments about what I'm missing or could do without, please let me know.
