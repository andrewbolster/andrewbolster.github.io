title: So what can you do with 32 Million Passwords...
---


So I have a piece of coursework for a [CS module](http://www.qub.ac.uk/schools/eeecs/Education/Undergraduates/ModuleSummaries/ModuleInformation/?CrsCode=CSC3048) I'm taking at [Queen's University Belfast](http://www.qub.ac.uk/schools/eeecs/) and one of the focal points of it is the recent [RockYou! SQL-injection breach](http://techcrunch.com/2009/12/14/rockyou-hack-security-myspace-facebook-passwords/) that released 32million passwords into the internet, and I thought I'd have a closer look at that list.

I 'acquired' the password list from your regular neighbourhood tracker, and thought I could walk through the process of getting a probability-sorted password dictionary.

(The '-S 2048K' memory restriction on the 'sort' program is to avoid Dreamhost locking out my process for being over-memory)

> tar -xvzf UserAccount-passwords.tgz

Having a look at the head of the resultant 'UserAccount-passwords.txt' file shows:

>

>
> $ head UserAccount-passwords.txt
>
>

>
> password
>
>

>
> mekster11
>

32million entries in arbitrary order arn't really that useful, so I sorted them alphabetically first (-d)

> sort -d -S 2048K UserAccount-passwords.txt -o UserAccount-passwords.sorted.txt

And getting a head again gave a whole pile of blank lines, so to get rid of them use [this handy sed expression](http://www.cyberciti.biz/faq/howto-linux-unix-command-remove-all-blank-lines/)

> $ sed '/^$/d' UserAccount-passwords.sorted.txt > UserAccount-passwords.sorted.unblanked.txt

So our first ten passwords are now:

> $ head UserAccount-passwords.sorted.unblanked.txt

!

!!!!

!!!!!

!!!!!

!!!!!

!!!!!

!!!!!

!!!!!

!!!!!

!!!!!

Loooots of duplicates, so we'll get rid of them

> uniq -cd UserAccount-passwords.sorted.unblanked.txt UserAccount-passwords.uniq.txt

The -d flag means that we only want to know about entries that appear at least twice, and  the -c means we only want one line for each password and a count for how often it appears (This reduced the number of lines in the list from 32,603,048 non-blank entries to 2,459,759), giving a first ten of:

> $head UserAccount-passwords.uniq.txt

12 !!!!!

67 !!!!!!

3 !!!!!!!

3 !!!!!!!!

8 !!!!!!!!!!

2 !!!"""Â£Â£Â£

2 !!!$$$

2 !!!???

2 !!!@@@

2 !!""Â£Â£

Still sorted alphabetically, so sort reverse-numerically to get most popular entries at the top.

>

>
> sort -nr -S 2048K UserAccount-passwords.uniq.txt -o UserAccount-passwords.uniq.sorted.txt

Giving our top 20 most popular passwords (sorry guys, but this is really depressing)

> $ head -20 UserAccount-passwords.uniq.sorted.txt

290729 123456

79076 12345

76789 123456789

There really is no hope for us...

More analysis to come when I can be bothered, and potentially some attempts at breaking into a VM with simulated user accounts.
