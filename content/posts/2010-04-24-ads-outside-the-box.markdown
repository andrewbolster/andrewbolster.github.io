I cant for the life of me remember who it was who pointed this out on Twitter, either @cimota or @stuartgibson.

[Jesse Schell](http://thingsifinished.blogspot.com/) , Author, Educator, Game Developer, Ex-[imagineer](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walt%20Disney%20Imagineering), Futurist, spendshalf of this video deliberating over the unexpected rise and rise of [facebook](http://www.facebook.com/).

The last half is what I found really interesting; Jesse eulogises on his image of points-based future, in line with [Lee Sheldon's High School XP Grade replacements.](http://www.switched.com/2010/03/26/prof-subs-grades-for-experience-points-presentations-with-quest/) If any of these predictions come true, I expect it's going to be a very interesting decade for advertisers.

Skip to 15:10 for a great discussion on [Device Convergence](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technological%20convergence) that actually changed my mind about convergence.

Skip to 17:20 for the start of the Points based life experience bit.
