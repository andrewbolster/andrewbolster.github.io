Currently, this is a major American congressional argument, and hasn't really come up publicly in Europe (outside of [Scandinavia ](http://www.circleid.com/posts/20091015_finland_legislates_universal_broadband/), but [Net Neutrality](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_neutrality) is going to be one of those issues that if people aren't made aware of it, the legislation removing it will sweep over all of us.

Imagine what would have happened if in 1998, ISP's had throttled the traffic going to a[ little rack in Stanford University](http://www.flickr.com/photos/jurvetson/157722937/) that would late take over the internet as [the great distributor of information](http://www.google.com). Imagine if Google couldn't pay the 'top-tier access fee' and had simply died.
