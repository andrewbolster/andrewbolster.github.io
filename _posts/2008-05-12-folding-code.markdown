title: Folding Code
---


I've been folding for a while now, and I'd previously written a really very cobbled together way of parsing my unitinfo.txt files, but, searching for something to do other than revise, I've written a similarly cobbled together but much shorter way of parsing my folding progress and telling me (as in speech) how far its going.

Required: Espeak, basic bash knowledge to adjust.

note: the espeak adjustments are just personal preference, so change them at will.

Its kinda a cheat cus it calls itself but isnt recursive. I'm just lazy

{% highlight bash %}
  #!/usr/bin/env bash
  case "$1" in
  "-v")
   points | espeak --stdin -s200 -v en+f4
   exit
   ;;
  "-w")
   points | espeak --stdin -s200 -v en+f4 -w $2
   exit
   ;;
  *)
   echo "Folding Stats at "&& date +%H:%M
   echo "CPU1:" && cat /var/folding/foldingathome/CPU1/unitinfo.txt | grep Progress | cut -d'[' -f1 | cut -d' ' -f2
   echo "CPU2:" && cat /var/folding/foldingathome/CPU2/unitinfo.txt | grep Progress | cut -d'[' -f1 | cut -d' ' -f2
   exit
   ;;
  esac
{%endhighlight%}

it doesnt look very pretty on the console but i think it sounds alright.

Better get some calculus done
