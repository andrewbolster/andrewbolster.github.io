So, a while ago I started  [personal logbook](//category/diary/) and wanted a way to keep those posts off the main blog (while still appearing in the RSS and twitter feeds).

Long story short, [Blog-in-blog](http://informationtakesover.co.uk/blog-in-blog-wordpress-plugin/) gets a given category off the main blog, and with thinks to the [wordpress.org support forum](http://wordpress.org/support/topic/379646) I was directed to the [Page Links To](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/page-links-to/) plugin, which added the necessary navigational behaviour.

Job Done!
