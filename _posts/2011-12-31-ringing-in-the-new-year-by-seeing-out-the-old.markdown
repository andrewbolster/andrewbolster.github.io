title: Ringing in the New Year by seeing out the old
---


2011 has been a great year for me;


  * Graduated with a 1st MEng in Electronics & Software Engineering @QUB,


  * Got Job offer to a [major financial house](http://lmgtfy.com/?q=sorgan+mtanley), which I turned down,


  * Got Job offer to a [C|EH](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Certified_Ethical_Hacker) company in England, which I turned down,


  * Got [DELNI](http://www.delni.gov.uk/) Funded PhD offer (x4) from CSIT/ECIT, which I turned down,


  * Got selected to be one of the two UK projects within a Joint UK/FR Defence PhD Programme, which I accepted,


  * Saw fantastic growth in [QUESTS](http://quests.society.qub.ac.uk/) and the [Hacker^H^H^H^H^H^HMakerspace]({{ BASE_PATH }}/2011/04/why-belfast-needs-a-hackerspace/), including the beginning of a [Major project](http://quests.society.qub.ac.uk/index.php/2011/heliests-eeecs-funding-request-submitted/), which we got [EEECS](http://www.qub.ac.uk/schools/eeecs/) Funding for and are also hoping to get [QAF](http://www.qub.ac.uk/home/Alumni/SupportQueens/DonatingtoQueens/QueensAnnualFund/) funding for QUESTS in general,


  * We are on track to get a actual space for the Makerspace circa Summer 2012,


  * Had the fantastic experience of living and working in Zurich for the summer with [IAESTE](http://www.iaesteni.org.uk/) / [Pc Engines Gmbh](http://pcengines.ch/), which gave me the opportunity to visit all over Europe, which was great for my confidence and self-belief, and also gave me a great many new friends all over the world,


  * Started (re-)learning French,


  * Came second in the UK Nationals of the [IET's Present Around the World ](http://conferences.theiet.org/ambition/present-world/index.cfm)Competition in Liverpool for my talk on Privacy in the Modern world (I keep meaning to screen-cast this but keep forgetting...)


  * Had a great time making an [interesting](http://so.wouldu.me) site with Matt Campbell, Alastair McKinley, and the Sisk Brothers (was live for a few days over the summer, and we didn't want to pay for it so let it die; may go back to it this year!)


  * Was asked to speak at the [QUB EEECS RS](http://www.qub.ac.uk/schools/eeecs/Research/ResearchSociety/) Colloquium, representing Digital Communications within QUB/ECIT.


  * Travelled over 6,000 Miles, visiting at least 12 cities in 7 countries.


  * Lost a phone and a bike,


  * Went on 12 'dates', 5 of which were worth while, 3 of which I'm still in touch with,


  * Taught at least 5 first years that C++ isn't magic, it's just poorly taught,


  * Sat on 5 committees, only one of which made me feel productive,


  * Had a pretty awesome time.

Going forward, I'm not going to make a load of promises I won't keep. Thanks to all my friends, family, colleagues, competitors, enemies, bureaucrats, pencil-pushers, and random-folk who made my year what it was.

I plan on only two things;  [KISS](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KISS_principle), and...
