title: MBWE Fuel Gauge -> Speedometer conversion
---


The Fuel gauge on the front of my MBWE is fairly useless, noone cares, so why not repurpose it as a speedometer?

first, stop it displaying the "fuel" Stolen from [http://kyyhkynen.net/stuff/mybook/reduce_disk_usage.php](http://kyyhkynen.net/stuff/mybook/reduce_disk_usage.php)

****

> **Disable the service that displays the disk usage** with the leds in the front panel of your MBWE. Admit it, the feature is pretty much useless and because the service has to check the amount of free space on the disk(s), it is causing disk access.

In order to prevent the service from starting during boot, edit /etc/init.d/S15wdc-fuel-gauge. Comment out this line:

>
>     $FGD &
>
>
Then stop the service:

>
>     # /etc/init.d/S15wdc-fuel-gauge stop
>
