title: Shaded Headers in Thematic
---


So, as you can see the blog is sporting a new, cleaner look. Nothing better than experimenting!  One of the nicer aspects of the new setup is the shaded headers (ie. `<h1>`/`<h2>` tags).

I started off my experimentation by going through [WebDesignerWall's walkthrough](http://www.webdesignerwall.com/tutorials/css-gradient-text-effect/) on the subject of text effects, but the limitation that I came across was that if you use their implimentation, any links (`<a\>`) in the header are lost 'under' the span.

Going from top to tail, this is how i have my gradients set up.  Download the gradient files ([white background]({{ BASE_PATH }}/wp-content/themes/penguincafe/img/gradient-white.png) / [black background]({{ BASE_PATH }}/wp-content/themes/penguincafe/img/gradient-dark.png)) and place them in whatever accessible image directory you are using. (If you get lost, [bloggingtips.com do a great overview](http://www.bloggingtips.com/2007/12/21/file-paths-in-your-wordpress-css-and-theme-files/))

Basically, the operation is to layer the gradient image over the text _inside_ the `<a>` tag's that are children of `<h1>`/`<h2>` ([hence the '>' in the CSS selector](http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-selectors/#child-combinators)), so that the gradient image itself is still a link. Don't worry about how the `<span>` tag gets there yet...  In whichever css file you are using add the following block of css.

{%highlight css%}


     h1 > a,h2 > a {
     position:relative;
     }
     h1 > a span, h2 > a span {
     background:url(path/to/gradient-whichever.png);
     position:absolute;
     display:block;
     width:100%;
     height:31px;
     }

{%endhighlight%}

If you are using a [thematic child theme](http://op111.net/53), the css file should be:


>   wp-content/themes/`<childname>`/style.css

The relative position is important as it is what allows the gradient image to overlay the text.  Next thing to worry about is getting the `<span>` tag inside the `<a>` tag without lots of legwork.

Welcome to [JQuery](http://docs.jquery.com/How_jQuery_Works) gentlefolk; it can do magic for your bloodpressure.  To keep it simple, add this function into your 'functions.php' (if you know you already have a JQuery script declaration, then you know enough to remove the relevant bit from below, if you don't, ask in the comments)

{%highlight javascript%}
     function shaded_headers() {
     echo <<<END
     <script type="text/javascript" src="http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.3/jquery.min.js"></script>
     <script type="text/javascript">
     $(document).ready(function(){
     //prepend span tag to H1 and H2
     $("h1 > a").prepend("<span></span>");
     $("h2 > a").prepend("<span></span>");
     });
     </script>
     END;
     }
     add_filter('thematic_head_scripts','shaded_headers');
{%endhighlight%}



And your done! This doesn't work for headers that aren't links, but I'm working on that (IANA JQuery Guru, help is you like!)
